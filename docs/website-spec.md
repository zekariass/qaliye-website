## 7. Technical Specification

### Recommended Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Framework | **Next.js 14+ (App Router)** | SSR/SSG, SEO, i18n routing, image optimization |
| Styling | **Tailwind CSS** | Matches app's NativeWind, shared design tokens |
| i18n | **next-intl** | Built-in Next.js i18n, URL-based routing |
| Icons | **lucide-react** | Lightweight, matches app icon style |
| Analytics | **Plausible** or **GA4** | Privacy-friendly, download tracking |
| Contact form | **Resend** / **Formspree** | No backend needed, email forwarding |

**Alternative:** Expo Web (the app already has `web.output: "static"`), but Next.js is recommended for SEO and i18n routing superiority.

### Routing Structure

```
/app
  /[locale]
    /page.tsx              → Home
    /about/page.tsx        → About
    /features/page.tsx     → Features
    /help/page.tsx         → Help
    /contact/page.tsx      → Contact
    /privacy/page.tsx      → Privacy Policy
    /terms/page.tsx        → Terms & Conditions
  /api
    /contact/route.ts      → Contact form handler (optional)
```

- URL pattern: `qaliye.app/en/features`, `qaliye.app/am/features`
- Default redirect: `/` → `/en` (or detected locale)
- Generate static params for all 4 locales at build time

### SEO Requirements

**Meta tags (per page):**
- `<title>` — page-specific, under 60 chars
- `<meta name="description">` — under 160 chars
- `<link rel="canonical">` — per locale
- `<html lang>` — set per locale

**OpenGraph:**
- `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image` (1200×630px), `og:url`, `og:type`
- `og:locale` — per language

**Twitter Card:**
- `twitter:card: summary_large_image`, `twitter:title`, `twitter:description`, `twitter:image`

**Structured Data (JSON-LD):**
- `SoftwareApplication` schema: name, description, operatingSystem, applicationCategory, offers, aggregateRating
- `FAQPage` schema on Help page
- `BreadcrumbList` on all pages
- `Organization` on footer/home

**Sitemap:** `sitemap.xml` with all locale variants  
**robots.txt:** Allow all, reference sitemap

### Performance Requirements

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) | < 2.5s |
| FID/INP (Interaction) | < 200ms |
| CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) | < 0.1 |
| Lighthouse score | 90+ all categories |
| Bundle size (JS) | < 200 KB gzipped |
| Images | WebP/AVIF, responsive `srcset` |
| Fonts | `font-display: swap`, preload Noto Sans Ethiopic |

- Use Next.js `Image` component for automatic optimization
- Static generation (SSG) for all pages — no server rendering needed
- Minimize client-side JS — mostly static content

### Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

- Semantic HTML: proper heading hierarchy (h1→h2→h3), landmarks (nav, main, footer)
- All images have `alt` text
- Color contrast: minimum 4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for large text
- Focus visible: purple outline on all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigable: tab order follows visual order
- ARIA labels for icon-only buttons (language switcher, social links)
- Form labels associated with inputs
- Skip-to-content link at top of each page
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` — disable animations
- Ge'ez script: ensure minimum 16px font size for readability

## 8. Content Guidelines

### Tone

- **Trustworthy:** Honest, transparent, no exaggeration
- **Culturally aligned:** Respect Ethiopian/Eritrean values, family-oriented framing
- **Modern:** Clean, confident, contemporary language
- **Respectful:** Inclusive, never objectifying, never pressuring

### Messaging Principles

- Lead with connection and meaning, not casual dating
- Emphasize safety, verification, and moderation prominently
- Be clear about what the app does and doesn't do
- Use "meaningful connections" over "hookups" or "casual dating"
- Reference cultural values: family, community, faith, heritage

### Privacy & Safety Messaging

- State clearly: "Your data is encrypted and never sold to third parties"
- Highlight verification and photo moderation as core, not optional
- Explain account deletion is available and permanent
- Avoid: "100% safe" or "guaranteed match" — use "designed for safety" and "meaningful connections"

### Prohibited Claims

- ❌ "Guaranteed matches" or "Find your soulmate"
- ❌ "100% safe" or "Completely risk-free"
- ❌ "Millions of users" (unless true and verified)
- ❌ Comparisons putting down other apps
- ❌ Promises about specific outcomes (marriage, relationship)

### Content Per Language

- All 4 languages must have **complete translations** — no partial locale
- Translations reviewed by native speakers (not machine translation alone)
- Cultural nuances: Amharic and Tigrinya may use more formal/respectful register
- Afaan Oromo uses Latin script — ensure consistent spelling standard
- English serves as fallback for any missing keys

### Legal Pages

- Privacy Policy and Terms must be **reviewed by legal counsel** before publication
- Clearly state 18+ requirement
- Include data retention and deletion policy
- Reference applicable laws (Ethiopian law if primary market)
